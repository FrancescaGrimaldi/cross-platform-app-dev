# cross-platform-app-dev
This repository contains both a simple lotto application and the final project developed using **React Native**, for the **"Cross-Platform Applications Development for Mobile Devices"** course held at NTNU during the Fall 2023 semester.

# Lotto application
This is a very simple application that we constructed as part of weekly assignments following the professor's guidelines, meant to demonstrate our progress and comprehension of the various subjects covered in lectures.

# Final Project
The implementation of an **e-commerce food app** which allows food items to be exhibited by stores and seen by customers, was the object of the course's final project. 
Along with basic search and filtering features, picture previews for every product are provided in the form of a small gallery. Users may quickly add products to their shopping cart or mark them as *favorites*. Additionally, the app enhances the shopping experience by offering personalized recommendations for additional products based on the customer's tastes.

The project specifications are accessible [here](https://github.com/FrancescaGrimaldi/cross-platform-app-dev/blob/main/INFT2508%20-%20Prosjekt%202023.pdf), while the real implementation and a more detailed description of all the app's functionalities and their technical aspects can be found in the [_SemesterProject_](https://github.com/FrancescaGrimaldi/cross-platform-app-dev/tree/main/SemesterProject) folder.
